					<p id="center">Halloween is a spooky tradition that dates back to the 6th century. It originated with the Celtics, and October 31st was the day they celebrated the end of the harvest season in a festival.Some pagan worshippers were involed in rituals where  dead ghosts would rise up. But as the catholic churchs influence grew in europe, it frowened on such religions. They then renamed the day "All Saints day" which honored the dead and martyrs. It then became to be known as "Hallowmus" translated to mass of the saints. It gradually  come to its name now as halloween! Now how did this holiday find it way in America?
       <br> 

       The holiday came to America with the wave of irish immigrants in the 1840's who came with their traditions and customs. One of the "traditions" was playing tricks on neighbors.Over the years the tricks turned into vandalism and extortions. Storekeepers and neighbors started passing out candy as a bribe to children, so instead of going door to door causing mayhem; they were going around collecting candy. By the late 1930's "trick or treat" became a holiday greeting.</p>
