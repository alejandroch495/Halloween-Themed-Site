        <p id="comfortaa" >Halloween is a spooky tradition that dates back to the 6th century. It originated with the Celtics,
	    and October 31st was the day they celebrated the end of the harvestseason in a festival.Some pagan worshippers were
        involed in rituals where dead ghosts would rise up. But as thecatholic churchs influence grew in europe, it frowened
	    on such religions. They then renamed the day "All Saints day" whichhonored the dead and martyrs. It then became
	    to be known as "Hallowmus" translated to mass of the saints. Itgradually come to its name now as halloween! Now
	    how did this holiday find it way in America? <br>
        </p >
        <p id="comfortaa">  The holiday came to America with the wave of irish immigrants in the 1840's who came with their traditions and customs. One of the "traditions" was playing tricks on neighbors.Over the years the tricks turned into vandalism and extortions. Storekeepers and neighbors started passing out candy as a bribe to children, so instead of going door to door causing mayhem; they were going around collecting candy. By the late 1930's "trick or treat" became a holiday greeting.

       </div>
        
        <p id="comfortaa">Halloween can be celebrated in many fun ways. The celebration of Halloween really starts at the beginning of October with many fun activities like Halloween parties, pumpkin patches, hunted houses/mazes, carving pumpkins into scary jack-o-lanterns, Scary movie marathons, and telling scary stories. This all leads to Halloween on October 31th where kids and adults dress up in costumes from princesses to a scary vampire or just as a hamburger. Kids then go around neighborhoods door to door asking for candy by saying “trick or Treat”.  <br>
